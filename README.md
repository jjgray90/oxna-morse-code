## Brief
A tech test style problem. I was tasked with adopting a TDD approach to build a morse code translator.

 - Users should be able to write english words/sentences into an input box and receive the morse code translation.
 - All functions should be tested, with functions written first.
 - As an extention, the translator should be able to translate both ways.
## Approach & Concepts:

- Test-driven development
- Pure Functions
